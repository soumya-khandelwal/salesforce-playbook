# Salesforce Playbook 📓

Hey! This is where I dump Salesforce things I've worked on, broken, fixed, and eventually understood.

## What's this about? 🤔

I'm starting with **Prompt Builder / GenAI** stuff because that's what I've been deep in lately. Might branch out into other Salesforce areas over time — or I might just keep nerding out on GenAI. No promises either way.

## The LinkedIn thing 🎥

I'm also doing a video series on LinkedIn where I walk through these concepts. Think of this repo as the "show your work" part — the actual metadata, configs, and code that back up what I'm talking about in the videos.

## What's in here 📦

- **Prompt Builder & GenAI templates** — the main focus right now
- **Lightning pages and layouts** — Record Pages, etc.
- **Custom fields and objects**
- **Metadata examples** — via `package.xml` for easy deployment
- **Will keep on adding more** — 

## Please correct me 🙏

If something's wrong, unclear, or there's a better way to do it — I want to know.

I'm learning out loud here. Mistakes are part of the deal.

## Why does this exist? ✨

Honestly? A few reasons:

1. **For me** — so I don't forget what I figured out
2. **For the videos** — so there's actual code behind the talking
3. **For you maybe** — if any of this helps, cool
